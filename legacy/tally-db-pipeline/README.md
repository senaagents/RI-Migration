# tally-db-pipeline

Standalone local-first pipeline for pulling data from TallyPrime and storing it in a normal SQL database.

This repo does not depend on Sena, Frappe, or any other internal platform code. It is intended to be cloned and run directly by the customer on their own machine.

Practical status documents:

- [LIVE_VALIDATION_NOTES.md](LIVE_VALIDATION_NOTES.md): what has been proven against real Tally installs
- [PRODUCTION_GAP_LIST.md](PRODUCTION_GAP_LIST.md): adversarial backlog of what still needs hardening

The current design is:

`CLI on your machine -> Tally HTTP/XML API -> local database`

There is no separate bridge service in this repo.

The extraction model is intentionally sequential:

- send one XML request
- wait for one XML response
- store the raw payloads and normalized rows
- then move to the next request

This is deliberate because Tally is fragile under overlapping requests.

The CLI also uses a local lock file so two commands from the same machine do not hit the same Tally instance at once by accident.

Important safety behavior:

- chunked, incremental, and profiled voucher commands validate that voucher dates returned by Tally stay inside the requested date window
- if Tally returns out-of-range voucher dates, the command fails instead of silently writing incorrect history
- some Tally installs appear to ignore or behave inconsistently with Day Book date variables, so this guard is intentional
- voucher-family sync requests may match multiple exact Tally voucher types under one normalized family, and the CLI will now print the matched exact types

## What this repo does

- connects directly to TallyPrime over its HTTP/XML interface
- reads master data and voucher data
- stores raw XML request/response payloads for audit/debug
- stores normalized records in a SQL database
- lets the customer use that database for reporting, exports, ETL, or custom tools

## What this repo stores

- companies
- groups
- ledgers
- stock groups
- stock items
- units
- godowns
- cost centres
- voucher types
- vouchers
- voucher inventory lines
- voucher ledger lines
- unknown/custom voucher XML sections that were not normalized yet
- raw XML payloads for every sync request
- sync run history
- sync checkpoints for incremental voucher pulls

## Important assumptions

- TallyPrime is running.
- Tally's HTTP server is enabled.
- The machine running this repo can reach the Tally machine over the network.
- Tally is usually reachable on port `9000`, but that should be confirmed in Tally settings.
- Voucher sync requires the exact Tally company name, including financial-year suffixes when present.
- For best reliability, keep the target company open inside Tally's UI while syncing.

## Before you start

You need these things:

1. Python `3.11+`
2. Git
3. Access to the machine where Tally is running
4. The Tally machine's IP address
5. The Tally HTTP port

## Step 1: Find the Tally machine IP address

If Tally is running on Windows:

1. Open `Command Prompt`
2. Run:

```bat
ipconfig
```

3. Find the active adapter
4. Copy the `IPv4 Address`

Example:

```text
IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 10.211.55.3
```

In that example:

- `TALLY_HOST=10.211.55.3`

## Step 2: Find the Tally HTTP port

In TallyPrime, check the HTTP/XML connectivity settings.

Most installations use:

- `TALLY_PORT=9000`

If Tally is configured with another port, use that value instead.

## Step 3: Clone the repo

Open a terminal on the machine where you want to run the pipeline.

Run:

```bash
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL_HERE> tally-db-pipeline
cd tally-db-pipeline
```

If you already downloaded the repo as a zip, just extract it and `cd` into the folder.

## Step 4: Create a Python virtual environment

On macOS or Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
py -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

On Windows Command Prompt:

```bat
py -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

After activation, your shell should show that `.venv` is active.

## Step 5: Install the project

With the virtual environment active, run:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e .
```

This installs the CLI command:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline
```

## Step 6: Create the `.env` file

Copy the sample environment file:

On macOS or Linux:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

On Windows Command Prompt:

```bat
copy .env.example .env
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

## Step 7: Edit the `.env` file

Open `.env` in a text editor and set the Tally host and port.

Example:

```env
TALLY_HOST=10.211.55.3
TALLY_PORT=9000
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./data/tally_pipeline.sqlite3
TALLY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=120
TALLY_REQUEST_DELAY_MS=250
TALLY_MAX_RETRIES=2
TALLY_RETRY_BACKOFF_MS=1500
TALLY_LOCK_FILE=./data/tally_http.lock
TALLY_LOCK_STALE_SECONDS=21600
```

Field meanings:

- `TALLY_HOST`: IP address or hostname of the machine running Tally
- `TALLY_PORT`: Tally HTTP/XML port
- `DATABASE_URL`: where the local database should live
- `TALLY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`: HTTP timeout for large Tally requests
- `TALLY_REQUEST_DELAY_MS`: pause between requests so Tally is not hammered
- `TALLY_MAX_RETRIES`: retry count for connection/timeouts
- `TALLY_RETRY_BACKOFF_MS`: backoff between retries
- `TALLY_LOCK_FILE`: local lock file that prevents concurrent Tally commands from this machine
- `TALLY_LOCK_STALE_SECONDS`: how old a lock must be before it is considered stale

## Step 8: Confirm the machine can reach Tally

Optional but recommended.

On macOS or Linux:

```bash
nc -vz 10.211.55.3 9000
```

If successful, you should see something like:

```text
Connection to 10.211.55.3 port 9000 succeeded
```

If this fails:

- Tally may not be running
- the Tally HTTP port may not be enabled
- the IP or port may be wrong
- firewall/network rules may be blocking access

## Step 9: Check that the CLI works

Run:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline --help
```

You should see the list of available commands.

## Step 10: Test the live Tally connection

Run:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline ping
```

Expected successful output looks like:

```text
Connected to Tally at http://10.211.55.3:9000
Companies visible: 1
- Example Company - 2025-26
```

If this fails with a connection error:

- recheck `TALLY_HOST`
- recheck `TALLY_PORT`
- make sure Tally is open
- make sure the Tally HTTP server is enabled

## Step 10A: Run a fast discovery probe

Run:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline discover
```

This returns compact JSON showing:

- whether Tally is reachable
- which companies are visible
- grouped company families for FY-suffixed company names
- warnings if Tally looks unhealthy or no companies are exposed

If you already know the exact company name, you can probe voucher-type access too:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline discover --company "Shanke Pvt Ltd - 2025-26"
```

## Step 10B: Run a human-readable diagnostic check

Run:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline doctor --company "Shanke Pvt Ltd - 2025-26"
```

Use this when the customer says something vague like "it worked once but not now".

`doctor` now distinguishes:

- `connection_error`
- `timeout`
- `line_error`
- empty company or master-data responses

and prints request durations so you can tell the difference between "cannot reach Tally" and "Tally is reachable but not responding usefully".

It also reports a high-level `health_status` such as:

- `healthy`
- `reachable_but_stalled`
- `reachable_but_no_companies`
- `reachable_but_no_master_data`
- `reachable_but_rejected`
- `unreachable`

## Step 11: List the available company names

Run:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline list-companies
```

This command is important because voucher sync requires the exact company name from Tally.

Example:

```text
Shanke Pvt Ltd - 2025-26
```

Copy that value exactly.

If the customer keeps each financial year as a separate visible company, inspect the grouped variants too:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline list-company-families
```

This groups names such as:

- `Shanke Pvt Ltd - 2023-24`
- `Shanke Pvt Ltd - 2024-25`
- `Shanke Pvt Ltd - 2025-26`

## Step 12: Initialize the database

Run:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline init-db
```

This creates the local SQLite database file automatically at:

```text
./data/tally_pipeline.sqlite3
```

You do not need to manually create the `data/` folder. The code creates it automatically for SQLite.

## Step 12A: Inspect the local database report

Run:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline report
```

This prints a JSON report with:

- local table counts
- recent sync runs
- recent failures
- whether any syncs are still marked as running

## Step 13: Pull master data

Before running this step, make sure the target company is open in Tally.

This command now uses collection-based pulls for groups and ledgers instead of starting with one heavy exploded `List of Accounts` report. That makes it much more reliable on larger Tally datasets.

Run:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline sync-masters
```

This pulls master data such as:

- ledgers
- stock items
- stock groups
- units
- godowns
- cost centres

## Step 14: Pull a dated item-wise stock summary snapshot

For opening stock or any dated stock valuation, do not use `Stock Item`
collection closing fields as a historical snapshot. Use the item-wise Stock
Summary report snapshot command:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline sync-stock-summary-snapshot \
  --company "Exact Company Name" \
  --from-date 2024-04-01 \
  --to-date 2025-03-31
```

This stores raw XML in `raw_payloads` with request type
`stock_summary_itemwise` and parsed item totals in
`stock_summary_snapshot_items`. It does not overwrite `stock_items`.

## Step 15: Pull voucher types

Run:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline sync-voucher-types --company "Shanke Pvt Ltd - 2025-26"
```

Replace the company name with the exact value returned by `list-companies`.

This step helps the pipeline understand custom Tally voucher names such as:

- `61 Sales`
- `12 Payt Bank`
- `2 Receipts`

and map them back to base types such as:

- `Sales`
- `Payment`
- `Receipt`

## Step 15: Test one voucher family first

Before doing a full sync, test one voucher type.

Example:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline sync-vouchers --company "Shanke Pvt Ltd - 2025-26" --voucher-type Sales
```

For dated voucher pulls, you can choose the range strategy explicitly:

- `--range-mode collection` (default)
  - uses a voucher collection narrowed by `SVFROMDATE` / `SVTODATE`
  - this is now the recommended historical voucher path
- `--range-mode daybook`
  - uses Day Book export with date variables
  - keep this only as a fallback/debug path on installs where collection mode behaves differently

Current recommendation:

- keep the default `collection` mode for historical voucher sync
- on our live Tally, this path correctly returned the full April Sales range, while the Day Book path under-fetched badly

Example:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline sync-vouchers --company "Shanke Pvt Ltd - 2025-26" --voucher-type Sales --from-date 2025-04-01 --to-date 2025-04-30 --range-mode collection
```

Other common voucher types:

- `Purchase`
- `Receipt`
- `Payment`
- `Journal`
- `Contra`
- `Credit Note`
- `Debit Note`

Or run the standard accounting voucher families in one command:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline sync-standard-vouchers --company "Shanke Pvt Ltd - 2025-26"
```

If you want it to keep going even if one voucher family fails:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline sync-standard-vouchers --company "Shanke Pvt Ltd - 2025-26" --continue-on-error
```

If the customer has a large history, start with a bounded date range:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline sync-vouchers --company "Shanke Pvt Ltd - 2025-26" --voucher-type Sales --from-date 2025-04-01 --to-date 2025-04-30
```

For larger history loads, use chunked date windows:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline sync-vouchers-chunked --company "Shanke Pvt Ltd - 2025-26" --voucher-type Sales --from-date 2025-04-01 --to-date 2026-03-31 --chunk-days 31
```

After the first range-based load, use incremental sync:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline sync-vouchers-incremental --company "Shanke Pvt Ltd - 2025-26" --voucher-type Sales --since-date 2025-04-01
```

Once a checkpoint exists for that company and voucher family, later runs can omit `--since-date`.

If no checkpoint exists yet and the company name ends with a fiscal-year suffix like `- 2025-26`, incremental sync can infer the starting date as `2025-04-01`.

If the customer does not know which voucher families are actually used, profile a date range first:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline profile-vouchers --company "Shanke Pvt Ltd - 2025-26" --from-date 2025-04-01 --to-date 2026-03-31
```

For larger profiling ranges, use the chunked profiler:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline profile-vouchers-chunked --company "Shanke Pvt Ltd - 2025-26" --from-date 2025-04-01 --to-date 2026-03-31 --chunk-days 31
```

If a chunked or profiled command fails with an out-of-range date-window error, do not trust historical or incremental voucher sync on that Tally instance yet. That means the chosen extraction path is not honoring the requested range reliably enough.

If the customer uses a mix of standard and non-standard voucher families, sync whatever the profiler actually finds:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline sync-profiled-vouchers --company "Shanke Pvt Ltd - 2025-26" --from-date 2025-04-01 --to-date 2026-03-31 --chunk-days 31
```

This also works for exact non-standard voucher type names discovered from Tally, not just the built-in accounting families.

The output includes a summary of how many voucher families were attempted, failed, or saved zero rows.

If the customer keeps each financial year as a separate visible company, you can profile or sync the whole family:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline profile-company-family --selector "Shanke Pvt Ltd" --continue-on-error
```

```bash
tally-db-pipeline sync-company-family --selector "Shanke Pvt Ltd" --continue-on-error
```

The selector can be either:

- the shared business stem without the FY suffix
- one exact company name with the suffix

These commands:

- discover the matching visible companies
- infer a start date from the FY suffix when possible
- profile or sync each company variant in sequence
- include custom/non-standard voucher families too

Current limitation:

- master tables and voucher types are now company-scoped in the local schema
- older local DBs upgraded from previous repo versions can still contain legacy blank-company master rows until they are cleaned up

To inspect or clean those upgrade leftovers:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline report
```

Look for the `legacy_global_master_rows` section.

Dry run the cleanup:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline prune-legacy-global-masters --dry-run
```

Apply the cleanup:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline prune-legacy-global-masters
```

## Step 16: Run the standard full sync

Before running this step, make sure the target company is open in Tally.

Once the single voucher test works, run:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline sync-all --company "Shanke Pvt Ltd - 2025-26"
```

If you want it to keep going even if one voucher family fails:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline sync-all --company "Shanke Pvt Ltd - 2025-26" --continue-on-error
```

This runs, in order:

1. master data sync
2. voucher type sync
3. Sales vouchers
4. Purchase vouchers
5. Receipt vouchers
6. Payment vouchers
7. Journal vouchers
8. Contra vouchers
9. Credit Note vouchers
10. Debit Note vouchers

## What database gets created

By default, this repo uses SQLite:

```text
./data/tally_pipeline.sqlite3
```

That is a normal SQLite file and can be opened by:

- `sqlite3`
- DB Browser for SQLite
- DBeaver
- TablePlus
- Python scripts
- custom ETL tools

## Using Postgres instead of SQLite

If the customer wants Postgres, set `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`.

Example:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://user:password@localhost:5432/tally_pipeline
```

Then install a Postgres driver:

```bash
python -m pip install "psycopg[binary]"
```

After that, run:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline init-db
```

## Common problems

### Problem: `Cannot connect to http://<host>:<port>`

Check:

- Tally is open
- HTTP/XML is enabled in Tally
- host is correct
- port is correct
- the machine running this repo can reach the Tally machine

Then run:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline discover
```

### Problem: `list-companies` works but vouchers do not sync

Most likely cause:

- the company name passed to `--company` is not an exact match

Fix:

- run `tally-db-pipeline list-companies`
- copy the company name exactly
- use that exact string in `--company`
- run `tally-db-pipeline doctor --company "Exact Company Name"`

### Problem: customer has custom voucher names

That is normal.

Tally often uses custom names like:

- `61 Sales`
- `12 Receipts Bank`
- `2 Payt Cash`

This repo handles that by syncing voucher types first and resolving each custom type back to a base type.

### Problem: some Tally setups have more voucher families than the default sync

That is also normal.

The default `sync-all` focuses on common accounting voucher families. If the customer depends on other families like:

- `Stock Journal`
- `Sales Order`
- `Purchase Order`
- `Delivery Note`
- `Receipt Note`

then those should be tested and added explicitly.

### Problem: Tally returns strange data or empty sections

Different customers may have:

- different voucher structures
- financial-year split companies
- local customizations
- custom voucher naming conventions

The protocol is the same, but the business data shape can vary. That is why the recommended first run is always:

1. `ping`
2. `list-companies`
3. `sync-masters`
4. `sync-voucher-types`
5. `sync-vouchers` for one family
6. then `sync-all`

### Problem: `sync-masters` returns no data or says no master data was returned

Most likely cause:

- the company is not currently open in Tally's UI

Fix:

- open the target company in Tally
- stay on that company
- run `tally-db-pipeline sync-masters` again

### Problem: one run worked, later runs hang or time out

Most likely causes:

- Tally is being hit with overlapping requests
- Tally is open but busy, half-loaded, or in a different UI state
- a large voucher family is taking too long for the current timeout

Fix:

- run only one command at a time against that Tally instance
- wait for one command to finish before starting another
- run `tally-db-pipeline doctor --company "Exact Company Name"`
- inspect `tally-db-pipeline report`
- if needed, increase `TALLY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`
- prefer `sync-vouchers-chunked` over one large historical pull
- keep adaptive chunk splitting enabled unless you are debugging a specific window manually

### Problem: company names contain `&` or other XML-sensitive characters

Fix:

- use the exact company name returned by `list-companies`
- do not manually replace `&` with escape sequences
- the CLI now escapes XML-sensitive values before sending them to Tally

### Problem: live Tally is unstable, but you have saved XML exports

You can still test parsing and database loading offline using:

```bash
tally-db-pipeline replay-xml --kind masters --file /path/to/list-of-accounts.xml
tally-db-pipeline replay-xml --kind voucher-types --file /path/to/voucher-types.xml
tally-db-pipeline replay-xml --kind vouchers --file /path/to/day-book.xml --company "Exact Company Name"
```

## Notes for customers

- Do not run multiple large syncs in parallel against the same Tally instance.
- Tally's API is sensitive and behaves best when requests are sent one at a time.
- If the CLI says a local Tally lock is already held, wait for the other command to finish instead of forcing another one through.
- This repo is an extraction pipeline, not a replacement for Tally.
- Always keep Tally as the source of truth unless the customer intentionally builds a downstream workflow on top of the synced database.
